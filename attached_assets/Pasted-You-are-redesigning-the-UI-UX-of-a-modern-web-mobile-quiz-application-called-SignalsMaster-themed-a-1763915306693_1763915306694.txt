You are redesigning the UI/UX of a modern web/mobile quiz application called SignalsMaster, themed around naval/military signaling. Your task is to generate clean, consistent, modern UI/UX code (Ionic + Angular + Tailwind) that matches the following design goals and acceptance criteria.

🎨 Visual Style & Theme

Create a modern light naval theme, not cartoonish, not dark and muddy. The UI should evoke:

naval command centers

maritime training tools

modern tactical interfaces

Use a consistent modern palette:

Primary: naval blue (#0A2A43)

Secondary: steel gray (#6E829B)

Accent: signal yellow (#F4D35E)

Background: light off-white (#F5F7FA)

Correct: military green (#2ECC71)

Incorrect: alert red (#E74C3C)

Use thin, clean borders, subtle shadows, and well-spaced sections.
Typography should be bold, readable, and crisp — think “military UI”, not “comic app”.

Apply these themes consistently across:

buttons

quiz containers

flag images

headers

footer/tab bar

progress indicators

📱 Layout & Responsiveness (Milestone: Responsive Layout)

Produce a layout that is fully responsive on small iPhone screens up to tablets:

No overlapping elements.

Buttons must remain large and tappable.

Text remains readable at all sizes.

Container widths must scale intelligently.

Use Tailwind utilities for spacing, typography, margins, and responsive classes.

🧭 Quiz Screen Requirements

Your layout should include:

A header with quiz title + subtle naval iconography

A large centered flag image with proper aspect ratio

Multiple-choice options as clean pill-style buttons

A fixed footer or bottom action area

Light background with enough contrast for buttons

🎯 User Interaction & Feedback (Milestone Features)
1. Smooth Transitions (Milestone: Smooth Transitions)

Add simple micro-animations:

Fade or slide between questions

No flicker

Next question appears within ~200ms

Subtle, modern motion — not distracting

2. Clear Correct/Incorrect Indicators (Milestone: Correct/Incorrect Indicators)

When a user selects an answer:

Correct answer button flashes or highlights green

Incorrect answer flashes or highlights red

Feedback remains visible for 1 full second

Then animate to next question

3. Thematic Quiz Interface (Milestone: Thematic Quiz Interface)

Ensure the UI feels cohesive, modern, consistent:

Buttons use same radius, font weight, and spacing everywhere

Flag images displayed cleanly with consistent sizing

No random shapes, mismatched shadows, or inconsistent colors

🛠 Output Expectations

Output:

Updated HTML template

Tailwind-based styling

Ionic components where appropriate

Angular animations for transitions

Any necessary CSS utility classes

Make the design production-ready, readable, and clean

Keep the tone and styling professional, tactical, and naval-themed, with a consistent visual identity.
